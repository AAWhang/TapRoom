## Description

_This program was created for the Eleventh Friday project assigned to the students of Epicodus Seattle May 28th class. This is a Website that will allow the user as a patron to view a menu of available drinks on tap. It will display details such as name, brand, price, alcohol content and number of pints left. As an employee it will allow you to add, edit and remove kegs from the menu. It will also allow you to deincrement the number of pints in each keg. There will be warnings if the kegs are running low. The price will be color coded for the patron. The kegs will organize themselves based on their alcohol content._
